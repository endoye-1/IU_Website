                    <h1>Silicon Chip Implant Marvel</h1>
                    <p> A silicon device that can change skin tissue into blood vessels and nerve cells 
                        has advanced from prototype to standardized fabrication, meaning it can now be made in a 
                        consistent, reproducible way. As reported in Nature Protocols, this work, developed by 
                        researchers at the Indiana University School of Medicine, takes the device one step closer to 
                        potential use as a treatment for people with a variety of health concerns.

                    <h1>Legal Implications, IU School Of Medicine</h1>
                    <p>There are always legal considerations. The researcher said he hopes to seek FDA approval for the chip within a year. Once it
                       receives FDA approval, the device could be used for clinical research in people, including patients in hospitals, health centers 
                       and emergency rooms, as well as in other emergency situations by first responders or the military.</p>

                <p> BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- While the American Rescue Plan Act 
                    provided a major infusion of economie aid to low-income and middle-
                    class Americans, more should be done to tackle racial wealth 
                    inequality and the structural issues in the tax code that allow those at 
                    the top of the income distribution to benefit disproportionately from 
                    tax subsidies, an Indiana University professor wrote.</p>
